Dashboard
=========

A Dashboard for monitoring my website. Will contain error logs, request logs/statistics, and maybe performance graphs.

This will be built on the Reverb framework (https://github.com/Ben5/Reverb) and will be hosted on the same server as my website, but will probably be only visible to me.
